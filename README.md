<h3> Project: </h3>
This is a command line app where two "players" play the game of war. The rules for war can be found here https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/war/
There are four classes 

<h3> Classes: </h3>
:spades:Player- represents actions the player can take<br />
:hearts:Card- represents attributes a card has<br /> 
:clubs:Deck- populates with 52 cards and can deal and shuffle<br />
:diamonds:WarGame- represents the "table" where the game takes place and contains the Main method. Objects are created here and the game is executed

<h3> Future Steps: </h3>
In addition to project requirements, in the future I would like to add<br />
:spades:Ability to play as a user instead of watching a simulation<br />
:hearts:Visualisation of cards
